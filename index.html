        <ul>
          <li>Cascading Style Sheets(CSS): language used to describe presentation of website that's created with HTML and how elements on webpage is rendered</li>
          <li>3 ways to style a webpage using CSS:</li>
          <ul>
            <li>Inline CSS: a developer syles an element directly in the HTML file</li>
            <li>Internal CSS: contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file</li>
            <li>External CSS: allows developers to keep all CSS rules in a seperate file, which makes design changes easier</li>
            <ul>
              <li>This is the most common and preferred style</li>
            </ul>
          
          </ul>
          <li>seperation of concern: seperating code into different files based on use</li>
          <li>Declaration: contain two important components: (1) the CSS property we want to apply and (2) the value of the property</li>
          <li>Do Not Repeat Yourself(DRY): a coding principle that encourages developers to reuse or share pieces of code in order to reduce the number of lines of code that need to be written or maintained</li>
          <li>Class Attribution: allow us  share a CCS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element</li>
        <li>CSS Commands:</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Margin: indicates how much space around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>padding: adds space around the content inside an element</li>
          <li>*: add when we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page</li>
          <li>display: assigned with the block value</li>
          <li>block: assigns each image to start a new line</li>
          <li>ul: delares the font and the padding on the left of the unordered list</li>
          <li>link: creates the connection to the external file</li>
          <li>rel: specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document resource</li>
          <li>href: specifies the location(URL) of the external resource</li>
