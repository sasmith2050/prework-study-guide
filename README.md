# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- I was modivated to create this webpage in order to give myself a good guide and refrence to refer back to as a progress through this course so that I can get the most out of the course and be able to preform at my best.
- I wanted to make sure that I had a good foudation to do my best in this course and believe that having a study guide to refrence in an easy to find location such as a webpage would be the best way to go about it.
- It'll help with time management when trying to reference information by having it all in one place. It also gives me one central place to put any new information that I come across as I progress through the course so I don't lose track of anything.
-  I learned about developing and using a growth mindset. I learned about psudocoding. I learned about agile software development. I learned the basics about the three building block langauges: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I learned about Git and GitHub. I learned about commandline.
